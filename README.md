# IR-Playbooks

Practical incident response playbooks to streamline detection, containment, and recovery from common cybersecurity threats.

These playbooks are intended to be a starting point for internal security teams within organizations.
They are written with many assumptions about the way the company is organized, what tools/technologies are available, and which priorities the security team likely hold. They will need to be **heavily modified** to fit any given organization.

Please also note that these playbooks are intended  to guide technical teams through the incident response process. They are **not** a replacement for legal incident response policies.

Feedback and suggestions for improvement are welcome :)
